# Omega Domains Homepage

## Overview

This was a project that I to undertook in order to become more familiar with using the Astro framework following the completion of their basic blog tutorial. I decided to do a clone of the GoDaddy https://www.godaddy.com/en-uk home page as I quite liked the design and felt the site had some interesting UI elements to build which would help to improve my CSS and Javascript skills.
