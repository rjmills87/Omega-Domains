<button class="accordion">Why do I need a website for my business?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    Even if they only serve their hometown, small local businesses require a
    website since the internet is often the first stop for people searching for
    a product or service. A website can help businesses in several ways, such as
    promoting and selling their products and services, connecting with new and
    existing customers, building credibility, competing with larger businesses,
    and managing their brand and marketing content. Fortunately, creating a
    website is much more accessible and affordable than many people assume.
    Omega offers a comprehensive suite of online tools to help businesses build
    their websites, as well as hosting, email, and marketing options to expand
    their online presence.
